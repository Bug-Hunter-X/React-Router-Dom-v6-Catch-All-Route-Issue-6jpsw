This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router Dom v6 where the catch all route '*' does not work as expected. The issue occurs when using the Routes component with multiple routes, including a catch all route. In this scenario, the catch all route is ignored, and the home page is always displayed.  The solution involves restructuring the routes or using a different approach to handle the 404 page.
